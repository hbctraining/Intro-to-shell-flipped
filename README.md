| Biologists | None | 3-session online workshop (~7.5 hours of trainer-led time)|

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 1-day Introduction to shell workshop. This workshop focuses on teaching basic skills to use the command line interface, specifically `bash`, the lessons include `for` loops, shell scripting, positional parameters. This workshop is a prerequisite to a workshop on [RNA-seq analysis](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/).

**Note for Trainers:** Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Navigate around the command line interface (bash/shell)
2.	Create and manipulate text files 
3.	Submit jobs to a high-performance computing cluster
