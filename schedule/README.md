  1. [Wildcards and shortcuts in Shell](../lessons/02_wildcards_shortcuts.md)
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>Perhaps you are interested in only listing the files that have a <code>.txt</code> extension or you want to navigate to your home directory quickly. There are many shortcuts in Shell that will help you do these types of tasks. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Utilizing wildcards for selecting multiple files<br>
             - Implementing shortcuts for moving around the Shell quickly<br><br>
        </details>
        
  2. [Examining and creating files](../lessons/03_working_with_files.md)
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>Now that you can navigate around the Shell environment, you are likely interested to know how to view and edit your files.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Viewing your files<br>
             - Editing your files using <code>vim</code><br><br>
        </details>
        
  3. [Searching and redirection](../lessons/04_searching_files.md)
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>You will encounter large files that need a search function to find the information you are looking for. You might also be interested in writing the output of that search to a file or use it as the input to another function.<br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Searching files using <code>grep</code><br>
             - Writing the output of a command to a file<br>
             - Redirecting the output of a command to an additional command<br><br>
        </details>

> **NOTE:** To run through the code above, you will need to be **logged into O2** and **working on a compute node** (i.e. your command prompt should have the word `compute` in it).
> 1. Log in using `ssh rc_trainingXX@o2.hms.harvard.edu` and enter your password (replace the "XX" in the username with the number you were [assigned in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBlYowhjjHJC9ZovmbBULmbqozKpprM17vZ2wPlhNg0/edit?usp=sharing)). 
> 2. Once you are on the login node, use `srun --pty -p interactive -t 0-2:30 --mem 1G /bin/bash` to get on a compute node.
> 3. Proceed once your command prompt has the word `compute` in it.
> 4. If you log out between lessons (using the `exit` command twice), please follow points 1. and 2. above to log back in and get on a compute node when you restart with the self learning.

II. **Complete the exercises**:
   * Each lesson above contains exercises; please go through each of them.
   * **Copy over** your solutions into the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrIjkOw6-vNmgDMlKQml49yFFEBKX1Z63dmSUyp_49-xeMCQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) the **day before the next class**.

## Day 2

| Time |  Topic  | Instructor |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| 09:30 - 10:10 | Self-learning lessons review | All |
| 10:10 - 10:55 | [Shell scripts and variables in Shell](../lessons/05_shell-scripts_variable.md)| Upen |
| 10:55 - 12:00 | [Loops and automation](../lessons/06_loops_and_automation.md) | Will |


### Before the next class:

I. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:

1. [Permissions and Environment Variables](../lessons/07_permissions_and_environment_variables.md)

      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>When using a multi-user system like the O2 cluster, you may want to limit access to your work. Permissions exist to clearly delineate who has the ability to read, write and execute your files.<br><br>
         Also, when working in a UNIX system, there are a core set of default variables that control the behavior of your command-line. One of the most important of these is the $PATH variable, which tells the system where to look for commands that you give it. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Interpreting and modifying existing permissions<br>
             - Querying environmental variables<br>
             - Reading and appending to the $PATH variable<br><br>
        </details>

2. [Introduction to High-performance computing](../lessons/08_HPC_intro_and_terms.md)

      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>Now that you had a chance to explore the O2 cluster, let's focus on the components of this system, how it is different than your personal computer and the advantages that it offers in terms of parallelization. <br><br>This lesson will cover:<br>
             - Differentiating a high-performance computing cluster like O2 from your personal computer<br>
             - Discuss the large parallelization advantage that O2 has over a personal computer<br><br>
        </details>

> **NOTE:** To run through the code above, you will need to be **logged into O2** and **working on a compute node** (i.e. your command prompt should have the word `compute` in it). For login instructions, please see above.

II. **Complete the exercises**:
   * Each lesson above contains exercises; please go through each of them.
   * **Copy over** your solutions into the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvw7yahfXZSB1jJZsGNLIzTf2Ip7JWj9G5Eh6_ycMuUYK-Kw/viewform?usp=sf_link) the **day before the next class**.
